# Day 3 | Jan 25 2026

## What I did
- Defined what "software" means in my identity
- Clarified what problems I solve vs. ignore
- Set Python scope: systems/hardware focus, not web/apps
- Defined Git expectations: proof of work, clean repos, daily commits
- Identified core tooling: Python, Git, pyserial, matplotlib, argparse

## Time spent
~20 min

## What I learned
**Software is my tool. Systems is my domain.**
I write software to *observe, automate, and interact with hardware* — not to build apps for users.

**Key contrasts:**
- I write scripts to observe systems, not apps for users.
- I parse protocols, not build REST APIs.
- I automate hardware tests, not deploy web services.

**Python MVC:** Write a working hardware-focused script in <1 hour.
**Git MVC:** Daily commits, clean repos, clear READMEs.

## What to ignore
- Web dev (Django, Flask, frontend)
- Advanced OOP, design patterns
- ML model training
- Competitive programming
